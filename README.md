# banking-system-golang
This project will involve the implementation, design, development, and deployment of a back-end web service from scratch. In my opinion, building a real application is the most effective way to learn programming. It also provides APIs for the front end to do the following things:

1.Create and manage bank accounts, which are composed of owner’s name, balance, and currency.
2.Record all balance changes to each of the account. So every time some money is added to or subtracted from the account, an account entry record will be created.
3.Perform a money transfer between 2 accounts. This should happen within a transaction, so that either both accounts’ balance are updated successfully or none of them are.

The programming language used to develop the service is Golang, design the database, generate code to talk to the DB in a consistent and reliable way using transactions, understand the DB isolation levels, and how to use it correctly in production. I utilized Docker for local development and GitHub Action to run unit tests automatically, in addition to the database.
